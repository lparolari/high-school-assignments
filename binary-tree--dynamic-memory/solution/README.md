# TODO

TODO: write the assigment based on the following...

* `solution/p0` is the solution implemented before the lecure. Should not be an exercise but only guideline.
* `solution/p1` is the solution implemented during the first lecture: this could be a first point of an exercise that asks to design a binary tree with few simple functions.
* `solution/p2` is the solution implemented during the second lecture: this could be an exercise asking to implement the construction of a binary search tree (i.e., ordered binary tree).
